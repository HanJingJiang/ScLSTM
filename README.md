In this repository, we provide implementations in Python of ScLSTM. The main branch of the repository (named ScLSTM) provides the code for the method and some example data. We recall that those data are provided purely as examples and should not be used in place of the ones provided in the respective publications.

The standard implementations of ScLSTM are provided in the scripts ScLSTM. 
Here's a look at each branch file:
main.py is the main code of ScLSTM
siamese.py is the code for the Siamese architecture
The data folder contains all the datasets used in this paper; the label folder contains labels for all datasets used in this paper.
CORR, POCR, SIMIR, SNN-Cliq, SinNLRR, and ZIFA, contain the complete code of the corresponding models.
